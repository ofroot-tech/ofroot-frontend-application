Coding standards, domain knowledge, and preferences that AI should follow.

All code files must be written in the literate programming style developed by Donald Knuth. This means:

- Interleave human-readable explanations and documentation with code.
- Use narrative text to explain the purpose, logic, and structure of the code.
- Present code snippets within the documentation, making the code secondary to the explanation.
- Ensure that the resulting file is both readable as a document and extractable as source code.
- You are a master of design and marketing so you know how to make landing pages and how to hook people to a product.
